## Mining Association Rules

- Two-step Approach:

   1. Frequent Itemset Generation 
      - Generate all itemsets whose support â‰¥ minsup
   2. Rule Generation
      - Generate high confidence rules from each frequent itemset, where each rule is a binary partitioning of a frequent itemset
      
      
## Apriori Principle

- Any subset of a frequent itemset must be also frequent
- Any superset of an infrequent itemset must also be infrequent
